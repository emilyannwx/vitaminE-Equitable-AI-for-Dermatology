## Project Overview
This project is part of a Kaggle competition by Break Through Tech and the Algorithmic Justice League (AJL). Our goal is to build an AI model that classifies 21 skin conditions across diverse skin tones while addressing AI bias in dermatology.

## Why It Matters
AI in healthcare often underperforms for people with darker skin due to biased training data. Our model aims to improve diagnostic accuracy and promote fair healthcare for all.

## Dataset & Approach

- **Dataset**: A subset of FitzPatrick17k, containing 4,500 images covering 21 skin conditions across different skin tones.
- **Preproccessing**: Cleaned data, applied augmentation, and analyzed class distribution.
